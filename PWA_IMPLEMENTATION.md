# PWA Implementation Guide for PaintQuote Pro

This guide provides details on the Progressive Web App (PWA) implementation for PaintQuote Pro with Supabase integration, including setup, configuration, testing, and future optimizations.

## Implemented Features

## Implementation Details

### 1. PWA Core Files

- **`next.config.js`**: Configured with next-pwa for service worker generation
- **`public/manifest.json`**: Web app manifest with app details and icons
- **`app/layout.tsx`**: Updated with PWA meta tags and viewport configuration

### 2. Configuration Notes

#### Service Worker Cache Strategy

The service worker is configured to use these caching strategies:

- **Google Fonts**: Cache First strategy with 1-year expiration

- **Static Assets**: Cache First with appropriate expiration times

#### iOS-Specific Enhancements

The app includes specific meta tags for iOS devices:

- `apple-mobile-web-app-capable`

- `apple-mobile-web-app-title`
- Custom apple-touch-icon sizes

#### Manifest Configuration

The manifest includes:

- App name and short name
- Start URL (/dashboard)
- Display mode (standalone)
- Theme colors
- Icons in various sizes
- App shortcuts for quick access

## Testing Guide

### Desktop Testing

1. Open Chrome, Edge, or another Chromium-based browser
2. Navigate to your app URL
3. Look for the install icon in the address bar (or 3-dot menu)
4. Click to install
5. Verify the app opens in its own window without browser UI

### Android Testing

1. Open Chrome on an Android device
2. Navigate to your app URL
3. You should see an "Add to Home Screen" banner or option in the menu
4. Install the app
5. Verify it launches from the home screen in full-screen mode

### iOS Testing

1. Open Safari on an iOS device
2. Navigate to your app URL
3. Tap the Share button
4. Select "Add to Home Screen"
5. Confirm and verify the app icon appears on the home screen
6. Launch and verify it opens in full-screen mode

### Test Checklist

- [ ] Proper app icon on home screen
- [ ] Full-screen mode (no browser UI)
- [ ] Correct theme colors
- [ ] Custom install prompt appears
- [ ] App functions correctly when launched from home screen

2. **Push Notifications**: For quote updates and reminders
3. **Advanced Offline Support**: Caching strategies for key app data
4. **Installability Improvements**: Additional prompt triggers and timing
5. **Analytics**: Track PWA installations and usage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Service Worker Not Registering**
   - Ensure HTTPS is enabled
   - Check for any console errors
   - Verify next-pwa configuration

2. **Install Prompt Not Showing**
   - User may have dismissed it previously
   - PWA criteria might not be met (icons, manifest, etc.)
   - Try clearing browser cache and service workers

3. **PWA Not Installing on iOS**
   - Verify apple-specific meta tags
   - Ensure proper icon sizes
   - Must use Safari (not Chrome) on iOS
