---

## Week 1: Quote Management & Copy-Paste System

### Prompt 1: Replace PDF with Copy-Paste Quote System

```
I need to replace the PDF generation system in my painting quote app with a copy-paste quote view. The app is at /Users/sepg/Desktop/painting-quote-app.

CURRENT STATE:
- App uses Next.js 14, Supabase, Tailwind CSS
- Has working chat interface at /app/(dashboard)/chat/[projectId]/page.tsx
- Currently uses @react-pdf/renderer in /lib/pdf-generator.tsx
- Quotes are stored in database with base_costs, markup_percentage, final_price, details
- Chat interface has "Generate Quote PDF" button that needs to be replaced

TASK:
1. Update /components/chat/chat-interface.tsx:
   - Replace "Generate Quote PDF" button with "View Quote" button
   - When clicked, navigate to `/quotes/[quoteId]` (create quote first if doesn't exist)
   - Remove PDF-related imports and functions

2. Create /app/(dashboard)/quotes/[id]/page.tsx:
   - Professional quote display (web-friendly version of current PDF layout)
   - Same content structure but optimized for screen viewing and copying
   - Include: company info, client info, itemized breakdown, total, terms
   - Add prominent "Copy Quote" button that copies formatted text to clipboard
   - Add "Share with Client" button (for future sharing feature)
   - Show quote status: Valid/Expired based on valid_until date
   - Mobile-responsive layout that looks professional

3. Create /lib/quote-formatter.ts:
   - `formatQuoteForCopy(quote, project, profile)` function
   - Returns professionally formatted plain text suitable for email
   - Include: company info, client details, itemized breakdown, total price, terms
   - Format should be clean and readable when pasted into any email client
   - Example output:
   ```
   PAINTING ESTIMATE
   
   Company: [Company Name]
   Contact: [Phone] | [Email]
   
   Client: [Client Name]
   Property: [Address]
   Date: [Date]
   Valid Until: [Expiry Date]
   
   SCOPE OF WORK:
   â€¢ Master Bedroom (180 sq ft) - 2 coats, better quality paint: $450
   â€¢ Living Room (250 sq ft) - 2 coats, better quality paint: $625
   
   TOTAL ESTIMATE: $1,075
   
   This estimate includes all labor, materials, and supplies.
   ```

4. Add navigation support:
   - Update /components/dashboard-header.tsx to include "Quotes" nav item
   - Link should go to quotes listing page

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Use existing design system colors from /app/globals.css
- Follow same layout patterns as dashboard
- Make it mobile-responsive
- Include copy success toast notification

The formatted text should be professional enough to paste directly into an email to a client, and the web view should be clean enough to share via link.
```

### Prompt 2: Quotes Listing Page

```
I need to create a quotes listing page for the painting quote app at /Users/sepg/Desktop/painting-quote-app.

CONTEXT FROM PREVIOUS WORK:
- Quote viewing page should now exist at /app/(dashboard)/quotes/[id]/page.tsx
- Dashboard header should have "Quotes" navigation
- Database already has quotes table with proper schema

TASK:
Create /app/(dashboard)/quotes/page.tsx with:

1. Header section:
   - Page title "Quotes"
   - Search input (search by client name or property address)
   - Filter dropdown for quote status: All, Valid, Expired (valid_until < today)

2. Quotes grid/list:
   - Card layout showing quotes in a responsive grid
   - Each card displays:
     * Client name and property address
     * Quote amount (final_price)
     * Created date
     * Status badge: "Valid" (green) or "Expired" (red) based on valid_until
     * "View Quote" button linking to /quotes/[id]

3. Data fetching:
   - Fetch quotes with project data (JOIN projects table for client_name, property_address)
   - Sort by created_at descending (newest first)
   - Include search and filter functionality

4. Empty state:
   - When no quotes exist, show centered message with "Create New Quote" button
   - Link to /chat/new

5. Design requirements:
   - Use existing card component from /components/ui/card.tsx
   - Follow dashboard layout pattern from /app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx
   - Use status colors from globals.css (success for valid, destructive for expired)
   - Mobile-responsive grid (1 column on mobile, 2-3 on larger screens)

REFERENCE FILES:
- /app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx for layout patterns
- /components/ui/card.tsx for card styling
- /app/globals.css for color scheme
- /types/database.ts for TypeScript types

The page should feel like a natural extension of the existing dashboard design.
```

## Week 2: Enhanced Navigation & Templates

### Prompt 3: Improved Navigation System

```
I need to enhance the navigation system in my painting quote app at /Users/sepg/Desktop/painting-quote-app.

CURRENT STATE:
- Header currently has just Settings and user dropdown
- Need to add proper navigation for the growing feature set
- Dashboard layout uses /app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx
- Quotes page should exist from previous work

TASK:
1. Update /components/dashboard-header.tsx:
   - Add navigation items: Dashboard, Quotes, Templates (for future), Settings
   - Use tab-style navigation or button group
   - Highlight active page based on current pathname
   - Keep existing user dropdown and branding

2. Create /components/ui/navigation-tabs.tsx (if needed):
   - Reusable tab component for navigation
   - Active state styling with primary color
   - Hover states with smooth transitions

3. Navigation structure:
   - Dashboard â†’ /dashboard
   - Quotes â†’ /quotes  
   - Templates â†’ /templates (create placeholder)
   - Settings â†’ /settings (existing)

4. Create placeholder /app/(dashboard)/templates/page.tsx:
   - Simple page with "Coming Soon" message
   - Same layout structure as other pages
   - This will be implemented in later weeks

5. Design requirements:
   - Use existing color system (primary: hsl(211 100% 50%))
   - Maintain clean, minimal aesthetic
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness
   - Smooth transitions on hover/active states

REFERENCE:
- Current /components/dashboard-header.tsx for structure
- /app/globals.css for color variables
- Next.js usePathname for active state detection

The navigation should feel intuitive and prepare for upcoming features while maintaining the clean Claude-inspired design.
```

### Prompt 4: Quick Start Templates

```
I need to implement a templates system for the painting quote app at /Users/sepg/Desktop/painting-quote-app.

BUILDING ON:
- Navigation should now include Templates link
- Placeholder templates page should exist
- Chat interface is working for quote generation

TASK:
1. Update database schema by creating /supabase/migrations/002_add_templates.sql:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS quote_templates (
     id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
     user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) NOT NULL,
     name TEXT NOT NULL,
     description TEXT,
     room_configurations JSONB NOT NULL,
     is_default BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW())
   );
   
   -- Add RLS policies
   ALTER TABLE quote_templates ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view own templates" ON quote_templates
     FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id OR is_default = true);
   
   CREATE POLICY "Users can create own templates" ON quote_templates
     FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
   ```

2. Replace /app/(dashboard)/templates/page.tsx:
   - Grid of template cards (default + user templates)
   - Each card shows: name, description, estimated price range, room count
   - "Use Template" button that redirects to chat with pre-filled conversation

3. Create /lib/default-templates.ts:
   ```typescript
   export const defaultTemplates = [
     {
       name: "Single Bedroom",
       description: "Basic bedroom painting with 2 coats",
       room_configurations: {
         rooms: [{ name: "Bedroom", sqft: 150, windowsCount: 2, doorsCount: 1, ceilingIncluded: false, trimIncluded: true }],
         totalSqft: 150,
         paintQuality: "better",
         coats: 2
       }
     },
     {
       name: "Small Home Interior", 
       description: "2 bed, 1 bath, living room",
       room_configurations: {
         rooms: [
           { name: "Master Bedroom", sqft: 180, windowsCount: 2, doorsCount: 1, ceilingIncluded: false, trimIncluded: true },
           { name: "Second Bedroom", sqft: 120, windowsCount: 1, doorsCount: 1, ceilingIncluded: false, trimIncluded: true },
           { name: "Living Room", sqft: 250, windowsCount: 3, doorsCount: 2, ceilingIncluded: false, trimIncluded: true },
           { name: "Bathroom", sqft: 60, windowsCount: 1, doorsCount: 1, ceilingIncluded: true, trimIncluded: true }
         ],
         totalSqft: 610,
         paintQuality: "better", 
         coats: 2
       }
     }
   ];
   ```

4. Update /components/chat/chat-interface.tsx:
   - Add "Start from Template" button in chat header  
   - When template selected, auto-fill the conversation with template details
   - Show indicator "Based on [Template Name]" when using template
   - Ensure generated quotes work with copy-paste system (not PDF)

5. Design requirements:
   - Follow existing card pattern from quotes page
   - Use template icons or placeholders
   - Show estimated price range based on average costs
   - Mobile-responsive grid layout

This will significantly speed up quote creation for common scenarios.
```

## Week 3: Client Sharing & Usage System

### Prompt 5: Client Quote Sharing

```
I need to create a client-facing quote sharing system for my painting quote app at /Users/sepg/Desktop/painting-quote-app.

BUILDING ON:
- Quote viewing system with copy-paste functionality should exist
- Quotes listing page should be working
- Database has quotes table

TASK:
1. Update quotes table with /supabase/migrations/003_add_quote_sharing.sql:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE quotes ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS share_id TEXT UNIQUE;
   ALTER TABLE quotes ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS share_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
   ALTER TABLE quotes ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS viewed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
   ALTER TABLE quotes ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS client_email TEXT;
   
   -- Index for share_id lookups
   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_quotes_share_id ON quotes(share_id) WHERE share_id IS NOT NULL;
   ```

2. Create public route /app/quote/[shareId]/page.tsx:
   - Clean, professional quote display (no authentication required)
   - Same formatting as internal quote view but client-focused
   - Company branding prominent
   - Mobile-first responsive design  
   - "Copy Quote" button for client to copy and save
   - No internal business data exposed (no cost breakdown, only final price)
   - Professional contact information and next steps

3. Update /app/(dashboard)/quotes/[id]/page.tsx:
   - Add "Share with Client" button
   - When clicked, generate unique share_id and enable sharing
   - Show shareable link with copy button
   - Track when quote is viewed

4. Create /app/api/quote/[shareId]/route.ts:
   - GET: Return quote data for public viewing
   - Include view tracking (update viewed_at timestamp)
   - Return 404 if share not enabled or doesn't exist

5. Create /lib/share-utils.ts:
   ```typescript
   import { nanoid } from 'nanoid'
   
   export function generateShareId(): string {
     return nanoid(12) // URL-safe unique ID
   }
   
   export function getShareUrl(shareId: string): string {
     return `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL}/quote/${shareId}`
   }
   ```

6. Design for public page:
   - Clean, trustworthy appearance
   - Company logo and contact info prominent
   - No dashboard chrome or navigation
   - Print-friendly styling
   - Professional typography

SECURITY:
- Share IDs must be unguessable (use nanoid)
- Only show final pricing, not internal costs
- Rate limiting on public endpoints
- No user data exposed in public routes

This creates a professional client experience with easy copying/sharing while keeping internal data secure.
```

### Prompt 6: Usage Tracking Foundation

```
I need to implement basic usage tracking for the painting quote app at /Users/sepg/Desktop/painting-quote-app.

BUILDING ON:
- Quote generation system is working
- Sharing system should be implemented
- Need foundation for future subscription features

TASK:
1. Create /supabase/migrations/004_add_usage_tracking.sql:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_usage (
     id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
     user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) NOT NULL,
     month_year TEXT NOT NULL, -- Format: "2024-01"
     quotes_created INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
     quotes_shared INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
     updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW()),
     UNIQUE(user_id, month_year)
   );
   
   ALTER TABLE user_usage ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view own usage" ON user_usage
     FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
   
   CREATE POLICY "Users can update own usage" ON user_usage  
     FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
   ```

2. Create /lib/usage-tracker.ts:
   ```typescript
   export async function trackQuoteCreation(userId: string) {
     const monthYear = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 7) // "2024-01"
     
     // Upsert usage record
     const { data, error } = await supabase
       .from('user_usage')
       .upsert({
         user_id: userId,
         month_year: monthYear,
         quotes_created: 1
       }, {
         onConflict: 'user_id,month_year',
         count: 'none'
       })
       .select()
     
     if (error) {
       // If record exists, increment
       await supabase.rpc('increment_quote_count', {
         p_user_id: userId,
         p_month_year: monthYear
       })
     }
   }
   
   export async function trackQuoteShare(userId: string) {
     // Similar implementation for quote sharing
   }
   
   export async function getCurrentUsage(userId: string) {
     const monthYear = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 7)
     
     const { data } = await supabase
       .from('user_usage')
       .select('*')
       .eq('user_id', userId)
       .eq('month_year', monthYear)
       .single()
     
     return data || { quotes_created: 0, quotes_shared: 0 }
   }
   ```

3. Create SQL function /supabase/migrations/005_usage_functions.sql:
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION increment_quote_count(p_user_id UUID, p_month_year TEXT)
   RETURNS void AS $$
   BEGIN
     UPDATE user_usage 
     SET quotes_created = quotes_created + 1,
         updated_at = TIMEZONE('utc', NOW())
     WHERE user_id = p_user_id AND month_year = p_month_year;
   END;
   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
   ```

4. Update /app/api/chat/route.ts:
   - Add usage tracking when quote is successfully generated
   - Import and call trackQuoteCreation(userId)

5. Create usage indicator component /components/usage-indicator.tsx:
   - Small badge in header showing "3 quotes this month"
   - Green color, subtle design
   - Clicking shows simple modal with usage details

6. Update /components/dashboard-header.tsx:
   - Include usage indicator next to navigation
   - Should show current month's quote count

This provides the foundation for subscription features while keeping it simple for now.
```

   - No external chart libraries needed for MVP

3. Create overview cards:
   ```typescript
   // Key metrics to display:
   - Total quotes created
   - Quotes this month  
   - Average quote value
   - Quote acceptance rate (if we add tracking)
   ```

4. Create /components/insights/metrics-card.tsx:
   ```typescript
   interface MetricsCardProps {
     title: string
     value: string | number
     subtitle?: string
     trend?: 'up' | 'down' | 'neutral'
     icon?: React.ReactNode
   }
   ```

5. Create /lib/analytics.ts:
   ```typescript
   export async function getQuoteMetrics(userId: string) {
     // Total quotes
     const { count: totalQuotes } = await supabase
       .from('quotes')
       .select('id', { count: 'exact' })
       .eq('project_id', projectIds)
     
     // Current month quotes
     const startOfMonth = new Date()
     startOfMonth.setDate(1)
     startOfMonth.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0)
     
     const { count: monthlyQuotes } = await supabase
       .from('quotes')
       .select('id', { count: 'exact' })
       .gte('created_at', startOfMonth.toISOString())
       .eq('project_id', projectIds)
     
     // Average quote value
     const { data: quotes } = await supabase
       .from('quotes')
       .select('final_price')
       .eq('project_id', projectIds)
     
     const avgValue = quotes?.length > 0 
       ? quotes.reduce((sum, q) => sum + q.final_price, 0) / quotes.length
       : 0
     
     return {
       totalQuotes: totalQuotes || 0,
       monthlyQuotes: monthlyQuotes || 0,
       averageValue: avgValue
     }
   }
   ```

6. Design requirements:
   - Grid layout with metric cards
   - Use existing card component
   - Simple, clean presentation
   - Mobile responsive
   - Trend indicators with up/down arrows where relevant

7. Add quick actions section:
   - "Create New Quote" button
   - "View All Quotes" button
   - "Share Quote" shortcut to recent quotes

Keep it simple and focused on the most important metrics for now.
```

### Prompt 8: Enhanced Client Experience

```
I need to enhance the client-facing quote experience in my painting quote app at /Users/sepg/Desktop/painting-quote-app.

BUILDING ON:
- Client sharing system should exist at /app/quote/[shareId]/page.tsx

   - Professional testimonial or trust signals

2. Create /components/client-portal/quote-timer.tsx:
   ```typescript
   interface QuoteTimerProps {
     validUntil: string // ISO date string
   }
   
   // Show countdown: "Valid for 23 days" or "Expires in 2 days" (red)
   // Use different colors based on urgency
   ```

3. Create /components/client-portal/contact-card.tsx:
   - Company name, phone, email
   - Professional layout
   - Click-to-call and click-to-email functionality
   - Business hours if available

4. Add quote actions for client:
   - "Accept Quote" button (placeholder - just shows "Thank you" message)

     const daysRemaining = Math.ceil((expiry.getTime() - now.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24))
     
     if (daysRemaining <= 0) return { status: 'expired', urgency: 'high' }
     if (daysRemaining <= 7) return { status: 'expires_soon', urgency: 'medium' }
     return { status: 'valid', urgency: 'low' }
   }
   ```

7. Track quote views in backend:
   - Update viewed_at timestamp when quote is accessed
   - Show view count in internal quote details

8. Add trust signals:
   - Licensed and insured badge
   - Years in business
   - Professional certifications (placeholder text)

Design should feel trustworthy and encourage clients to accept quotes quickly.
```

## Implementation Notes

### Dependencies & Order
1. **Week 1**: Foundation changes (copy-paste system, quotes listing)
2. **Week 2**: Navigation enhancement, templates build on existing structure  
3. **Week 3**: Sharing builds on quotes system, usage tracking is independent
4. **Week 4**: Analytics uses existing data, client portal enhances sharing

### Key Files to Reference
- `/app/globals.css` - Color system and design tokens
- `/components/ui/` - Existing UI components
- `/types/database.ts` - TypeScript types
- `/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Layout patterns
- `/components/chat/chat-interface.tsx` - Current functionality

### Database Migration Strategy
- Each week adds new tables/columns via numbered migrations
- Build on existing schema (profiles, projects, quotes, chat_messages, cost_settings)
- Include proper RLS policies from start

### Testing Approach
For each prompt:
- [ ] Mobile responsive design
- [ ] Uses existing color system
- [ ] Proper TypeScript types
- [ ] Error handling and loading states
- [ ] Follows established patterns
- [ ] Database queries are optimized

### Current vs Planned Features

**âœ… Currently Working:**
- Chat-based quote generation
